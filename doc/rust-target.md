# ANTLR4 Runtime for Rust

### First steps

#### 1. Install ANTLR4

[The getting started guide](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md) 
should get you started.

#### 2. Install the Rust ANTLR runtime

Each target language for ANTLR has a runtime package for running parser 
generated by ANTLR4. The runtime provides a common set of tools for using your parser.

Add antlr-rust and lazy_static dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
lazy_static = "1.4"
antlr-rust = "0.1.0"
```

#### 3. Generate your parser

You use the ANTLR4 "tool" to generate a parser. These will reference the ANTLR 
runtime, installed above.

Suppose you're using a UNIX system and have set up an alias for the ANTLR4 tool 
as described in [the getting started guide](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md). 
To generate your Rust parser, run the following command:

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Rust MyGrammar.g4
```

For a full list of antlr4 tool options, please visit the 
[tool documentation page](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/tool-options.md).
